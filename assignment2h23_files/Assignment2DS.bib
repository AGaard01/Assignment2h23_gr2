  abstract = {There is growing evidence that firm-specific pay premiums are an important source of wage inequality. These premiums will contribute to the gender wage gap if women are less likely to work at high-paying firms or if women negotiate (or are offered) worse wage bargains with their employers than men. Using longitudinal data on the hourly wages of Portuguese workers matched with income statement information for firms, we show that the wages of both men and women contain firm-specific premiums that are strongly correlated with simple measures of the potential bargaining surplus at each firm. We then show how the impact of these firm-specific pay differentials on the gender wage gap can be decomposed into a combination of sorting and bargaining effects. We find that women are less likely to work at firms that pay higher premiums to either gender, with sorting effects being most important for low- and middle-skilled workers. We also find that women receive only 90\% of the firm-specific pay premiums earned by men. Importantly, we find the same gender gap in the responses of wages to changes in potential surplus over time. Taken together, the combination of sorting and bargaining effects explain about one-fifth of the cross-sectional gender wage gap in Portugal.},

  abstract = {Nations power their economic growth capitalizing on their integrated workforce whereby male and female workforce join the productivity ranks to maximize financial returns, boost the productive sectors, and move the country to higher ranks of achieving the highest utilization of the human resources available to them. However, the aforementioned objectives are hindered to variable degrees depending on the category of the nation's income (Khokhar \& Serajuddin, 2015). More specifically, there are many economic variables (IMF, 2015) that characterize the economic state of each nation including GDP, purchasing power parities (PPPs), annual inflation rates, currency and exchange rates, human development indices, unemployment rates, balance of payment, and foreign trade, among others. However, weaknesses in human development practices and efficiency in the labor market may lead to negative consequences. One such weakness is gender discrimination and its consequent wage gap discrimination. Hejase et al. (2015) contend that the analysis of the gender wage gap has been an active subject within the socioeconomic domains around the world. Much of this gap occurs at the upper rungs of the organizational ladder, even among females with credentials or achievements to their names. Further, Hejase et al. (2014) argue that the individuals' skills, productivity, and commitment to work ultimately determine their incomes sounds too na\"ive to explain the earnings' differential between males and females. In fact, discrimination against females may occur at different stages of their career path. The wage gap is apparent at the top (glass ceiling) as well as at the bottom (sticky floors) of wage distribution.}

  abstract = {In this article, we survey the theoretical literature investigating the role of gender inequality in economic development. The vast majority of theories reviewed argue that gender inequality is a barrier to development, particularly over the long run. Among the many plausible mechanisms through which inequality between men and women affects the aggregate economy, the role of women for fertility decisions and human capital investments is particularly emphasized in the literature. Yet, we believe the body of theories could be expanded in several directions.},
